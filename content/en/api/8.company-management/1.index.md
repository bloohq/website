description: Overview of company management operations in the Blue API.
---

The Blue API provides comprehensive company management capabilities, allowing you to create, query, and manage companies within your Blue workspace.

## Available Operations

### Creating Companies
- [Create a Company](/api/company-management/create-company) - Create new companies with custom names and slugs

### Querying Companies
- [Query Company](/api/company-management/query-company) - Retrieve company information using ID or slug

## Key Concepts

### Company Identification
Companies in Blue can be identified using two methods:
1. **Company ID** - A unique identifier (CUID) automatically generated when creating a company
2. **Company Slug** - A URL-friendly identifier that you specify when creating a company

### Access Control
- Users can only access companies where they are members
- Company operations respect user permissions and access levels
- Banned companies cannot be accessed through the API

### Billing Considerations
Each company in Blue is billed separately, so creating new companies may affect your account billing.
