## Create a Dashboard

The `createDashboard` mutation allows you to create a new dashboard within your company or project. Dashboards are powerful visualization tools that help teams track metrics, monitor progress, and make data-driven decisions.

### Basic Example

```graphql
mutation CreateDashboard {
  createDashboard(
    input: {
      companyId: "comp_abc123"
      title: "Sales Performance Dashboard"
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    createdBy {
      id
      email
      firstName
      lastName
    }
    createdAt
  }
}
```

### Project-Specific Dashboard

Create a dashboard associated with a specific project:

```graphql
mutation CreateProjectDashboard {
  createDashboard(
    input: {
      companyId: "comp_abc123"
      projectId: "proj_xyz789"
      title: "Q4 Project Metrics"
    }
  ) {
    id
    title
    project {
      id
      name
    }
    createdBy {
      id
      email
    }
    dashboardUsers {
      id
      user {
        id
        email
      }
      role
    }
    createdAt
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Automatic ownership**: The user creating the dashboard automatically becomes its owner with full permissions
- **Project association**: If you provide a `projectId`, it must belong to the same company
- **Initial permissions**: Only the creator has access initially. Use `editDashboard` to add more users
- **Title requirements**: Dashboard titles must be non-empty strings. There's no uniqueness requirement
- **Company membership**: You must be a member of the company to create dashboards in it

## Dashboard Creation Workflow

1. **Create the dashboard** using this mutation
2. **Configure charts and widgets** using the dashboard builder UI
3. **Add team members** using the `editDashboard` mutation with `dashboardUsers`
4. **Set up filters and date ranges** through the dashboard interface
5. **Share or embed** the dashboard using its unique ID

## Use Cases

1. **Executive dashboards**: Create high-level overviews of company metrics
2. **Project tracking**: Build project-specific dashboards to monitor progress
3. **Team performance**: Track team productivity and achievement metrics
4. **Client reporting**: Create dashboards for client-facing reports
5. **Real-time monitoring**: Set up dashboards for live operational data

## Best Practices

1. **Naming conventions**: Use clear, descriptive titles that indicate the dashboard's purpose
2. **Project association**: Link dashboards to projects when they're project-specific
3. **Access management**: Add team members immediately after creation for collaboration
4. **Organization**: Create a dashboard hierarchy using consistent naming patterns
