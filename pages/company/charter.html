                This document reflects the philosophy we've developed since our founding in 2018, including extensive feedback from over 17,000 organizations across 120+ countries. As the future of work continues to evolve, our Charter will guide us in acting in the best interests of organizations worldwide.

            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">To that end, we commit to the following principles:</p>

                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
                    We commit to maintaining complete independence from investor pressures that might compromise our commitment to customer success, affordability, or long-term thinking. <u>Our primary obligation is to our customers and their success.</u>
                </p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
                    As a self-funded company, we make decisions based on what customers actually need, not what maximizes quarterly returns or satisfies external stakeholders. Every feature, pricing decision, and strategic choice will be evaluated through the lens of customer benefit.
                </p>

                    We reject the notion that all organizations should follow the same <em>"best practices."</em> True competitive advantage comes from doing things differently, not from copying what everyone else does.
                </p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
                    While the industry pushes standardized workflows and generic templates, we believe organizations should differentiate themselves through their unique business processes. Your competitive edge shouldn't be sacrificed for the convenience of one-size-fits-all software.
                </p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
                    Blue adapts to your unique processes, not the other way around. We provide the foundation for you to build processes that reflect your organization's unique strengths, culture, and strategic advantages.

                    We commit to ensuring that powerful work organization tools remain accessible to all teams, not just well-funded enterprises. We will resist the industry trend toward increasingly complex and expensive solutions that exclude smaller organizations.

                    Enterprise-grade capabilities should not require enterprise budgets. We believe that a 5-person startup deserves the same sophisticated process management tools as a 5,000-person corporation.
